This repository gives a basic example of what not to do when it comes to building tabbable forms that are accessible and easy to use.

It was originally build to be used with the slide deck found [here](https://github.com/AustinNChristensen/Accessibility-Slides)

# TODO
- Add Checkbox to Form Example
- Switch radio button groupset to use aria role groupset with a ul
- Modify form programatic alerts and form validation using [this article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/forms/alerts)
