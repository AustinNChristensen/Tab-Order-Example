This repository gives a basic example of what not to do when it comes to building tabbable forms that are accessible and easy to use.

It was originally built to be used with the slide deck found [here](https://github.com/AustinNChristensen/Accessibility-Slides)

# TODO
- Switch radio button group set to use aria role group set with a ul
- Modify form programmatic alerts and form validation using [this article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/forms/alerts)
